           When collecting information about our proposed system, First we gather information about previously done research projects using published research papers. But at this point we did not find a research project that was similar to our proposed system. So, we have found information about previously done research component by component. So, the very first component of our system is the Game module. Game developing is one of the major developing areas in information technology. Game making is a creative art. So, developers make their games using their creativity. Game developers use different game making softwares to make their games. Android studio, Unity 3D, Unreal game engine are few major softwares that game developers are mainly used. </p>

            Nowadays in the world there is a rapid development in smartphones. Because of that the Android platform became more popular among smartphones. And also the mobile games based on the android became more popular in the world. In this paper Andengine engine was used to develop the game. In this game platform they use mainly four functions.

              Rebecca Hincks “Using speech recognition to evaluate skills in spoken English”[5]
            </b></p>
<p><h5>The PhonePass Test </h5></p>

          <p>
 The PhonePass test uses automatic speech recognition to assess facility in spoken English. It is designed as a simple way for organizations to test the English skills of potential employees or students. To administer the test, an organization purchases test papers from Ordinate Corp. Each test paper is unique, though the items are recombined to make other tests. To take the test, the examinee calls a phone number in California and is connected with a computer. The examinee enters his test paper number on the telephone keypad and then follows instructions. The test results are soon available on the company website. The test consists of five parts. This paper concerns results derived from Part A, Reading, where the examinee is instructed to read a set of sentences. The recognition engine can assess how the examinee’s pronunciation of each word in the sentence compares with acceptable pronunciations, and measure the rate at which the examinee reads. The speech processing used by Ordinate Corporation was trained with the speech of native speakers and adapted for use by nonnative speakers. It uses forced alignment to locate the relevant parts of the speech signal, an HMM-based speech recognizer, a pronunciation dictionary, and an expected-response network constructed from responses collected in over 4000 administrations of the test (Bernstein 1999) [5].
          </p>

<p><h5>Reading Fluency </h5></p>

          <p>
In Part A, Reading, the examinee is asked to read aloud eight of the twelve sentences on the test paper. Data gathered from this part of the test determine the scores for two subscores: Reading Fluency and Pronunciation (Townshend 1998) [5].</p>
          <div class="img_box_w_cap">

            <img class="fullsizeimage" src="images/lits/l3.png" alt="">
            <p><i>Figure III: Reading Fluency, before and after, by student.</i></p>
          </div>

          <p>The lowest score shown in Figure 1 was Mrmfa’s second trial. The highest result was Tmmro’s second trial. Coincidentally, these two tests contained three sentences in common. Examinee Tmmro, with a score of 6.9, read these sentences twice as quickly as Mrmfa, who had a score of 3.5. Table 1 shows the sentences and the speed at which they were read [5].</p>
          <div class="img_box_w_cap">

            <p><i>Table I: Reading speed for selected utterances, best and worst scoring students</i></p>
          </div>
<p><h5>Pronunciation  </h5></p>
          <p>Part A of the PhonePass test also provides data for the Pronunciation subscore. Students’ before and after results on the pronunciation subscore are shown in Figure </p>

          </div>

          <p>
           Bwmpo’s Pronunciation score can have been pulled down by the fact that the second set of sentences contained more words that he had particular problems with. The positive effect of the more natural prosody present in the second trial is not reflected in this score, though it can be seen in Figure 1 that his Reading Fluency score increased by more than half a point [5].

<p><h5>Identification of aspects in Written English  </h5></p>

<p>Practically every employment will require some level of Written English abilities, regardless of whether it is sending messages, composing updates or giving briefs and reports. The capacity to convey briefly and clearly using Written aspects guarantees that everybody you work with comprehends what you are going to express. Written English skills can be considered as those which are important to express what is on your mind using Written aspects such as letters and emails. Although it seems to be equal compared to the verbal language, written language differs a lot compared to verbal language rules. The verbal language utilizes body movements and tone while written language depends on syntax, punctuations and word decision. It is important  to notice that to develop Written English skills, it requires practice, time and interest. Since Written English skills are so significant nowadays, it is also important to make an effort to improve them. The Written English language is composed of 5 major key elements as discussed below.</p>
          <div class="img_box_w_cap">

        <p>  <h5>Evaluation of the question making process parallel to identified Written English aspects</h5></p>
          <p>
           The main focus of this research is to improve the English knowledge of rural students who are in grade 06. Therefore it is important to prepare questions to suit the rural society preserving the identified aspects of Written English. According to the above discussion there are 6 main areas in Written English language as clarity, conciseness, tone, active voice, grammar and punctuation. This section explains how the types of questions are selected to cater the mentioned areas.
          </p>
          <p>
          There are various question types in the academic world including essay type questions, structured type questions, true or false questions, fill in the blank questions, multiple choice questions and matching questions. According to the English lessons allocated for the grade 06, the main focus is on structured type questions, multiple choice questions, fill in the blank questions and true or false questions. On the other hand among the identified areas in Written English, grade 06 pupils book mainly focuses on grammar, punctuation and conciseness. Therefore by considering both consisting question types and consisting Written English areas, 10 exercises are created within the component.

           Most of the institution and schools using final examination grade of the student as the student.Academic performance criteria. The final grades of any student depend on assessment and test. The performance  of the student depends upon how many grades a student score in the final examination. Norlida Buniyamin, Pauziah Mohd  Arsad  et  al. (2013)  stated  that  what are  the  significance  of  academic analytics  for  an  educational institution  and  how  they  work  for  the  improvement  of  education.  They  also  proposed  an  intelligent recommendation intervention system to improve the student’s performance and achievement in education.

            Computers have become ubiquitous, especially in the last three decades, and are significantly widespread. This has led to the collection of vast volumes of heterogeneous data, which can be utilized for discovering unknown patterns and trends (Han et al., 2011), as well as hidden relationships (Sumathi & Sivanandam, 2006), using data mining techniques and tools (Fayyad & Stolorz, 1997). The analysis methods of data mining can be roughly categorized as: 1) classical statistics methods (e.g. regression analysis, discriminant analysis, and cluster analysis) (Hand, 1998), 2) artificial intelligence (Zawacki-Richter, Marín, Bond, & Gouverneur, 2019) (e.g. genetic algorithms, neural computing, and fuzzy logic), and 3) machine learning (e.g. neural networks, symbolic learning, and swarm optimization) (Kononenko & Kukar, 2007). The latter consists of a combination of advanced statistical methods and AI heuristics. These techniques can benefit various fields through different objectives, such as extracting patterns, predicting behavior, or describing trends. A standard data mining process starts by integrating raw data – from different data sources – which is cleaned to remove noise, duplicated or inconsistent data. After that, the cleaned data is transformed into a concise format that can be understood by data mining tools, through filtering and aggregation techniques. Then, the analysis step identifies the existing interesting patterns, which can be displayed for a better visualization (Han et al., 2011) .

           To accomplish our goals, we developed a predictive analytic model utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms. ,e most appropriate ML predictive model was selected for analyzing student interactions in VLE learning activities and determining students’ levels of engagement in VLE courses given that a lack of student engagement results in a high dropout rate . Predictive models are currently used in many educational institutions  A predictive model can help instructors guide students in succeeding in a course, and be used to determine which activities and materials are more important to the course assessment. Such models also enable instructors to engage students in different activities through the VLE, thereby encouraging the students to participate in the VLE course. Instructors must invest time discerning why student engagement in particular course activities and material is attenuated. Our models can easily be integrated into VLE systems and can enable teachers to identify low-engagement students through different assessments, the use of different course materials, and the number of times VLE activities (e.g., dataplus, forumng, glossary, resources, URL, homepage, oucollaborate, and subpages) are accessed. Teachers can also spend more time on assessments and materials that are difficult for a particular group of students, enabling them to discover why an assessment is easy or difficult and providing supplementary intervention to students who need it. A predictive system enables an instructor to automatically identify low-engagement students during a course based on activities from that online course. Given such detection, the instructor can then motivate (e.g., send an e-mail reminder) or identify difficulties during the course . When a student receives an advisory e-mail from an instructor (i.e., an e-mail asking about any difficulty), on a weekly basis, the student is more likely to work hard and increase their engagement. Such communication is important because it assesses student workloads and addresses issues at an early stage of the course . Apt advice will also improve student retention and decrease the course dropout rate

          <p>
            The lack of English expertise is one of the key causes for joblessness. The key evidence of this is that the lack of English literacy has become a major barrier for graduates to pursue work opportunities , especially within the private sector. From now on, the business sector tends to use non-graduates with a high degree of language skills, as opposed to graduates. The ability to speak English is an inspiring effect on career performance and social interactions. Comparatively, a very significant portion of graduates understand the value of English language skills while employed behind a position. The object of no return at that time is always past.

            With the rapid enchantment of technology, the use of cell phones has risen considerably. Modern culture, however, continues to use smartphones to make their lives simpler than to adhere to conventional practices. The most significant fact is that this is followed not only by teenagers, but also by youth and children. The perfect explanation is that most parents use online learning channels like Youtube to educate students using videos. As a result, students in Grade 06 are usually not interested in learning using books but using online approaches directly related to mobile technology. Compared to the global academy, most developing countries use this process, which has produced promising effects when used within the limits. In Sri Lanka, however, the assets available to students, especially those who are starting secondary education, are very small.

           Sri Lanka is one of the most qualified nations in the world. Therefore, without debate, Sri Lanka's school system is at a higher standard. Yet Sri Lanka is also known to be one of the developed countries in the world. The key explanation for this is the technical gap that holds students away from meeting their targets, especially in rural areas. Most students learn to use e-learning when they begin their higher education. It is also clear that if the fundamental basis for the proper use of online assets is taught to students during their secondary education, it is possible for us to achieve the highest level as a country.

            On the other hand, although there are several solutions developed to fulfill different requirements of English in the world, there are some key elements missing in them. One main key element is that the complete composition of English language is missing when a single solution is selected. For example, 'Memrise' focuses only on Written English language. Therefore there is a huge gap in the local environment to deploy a compound solution catering all aspects of English. Further most of prevailing products web based solutions or either organizational based products. In a situation where the solution is a complex web based application which cannot be operated with a mobile phone, the students without laptops or computers are automatically ejected from the list of possible users. Also if the product is an organizational based solution, the users who are not within the organization should pay to obtain the service. Also all the complex web applications and organizational products are less portable. This also makes a huge gap within the academic system keeping many students with less facilities away from using them. 
          </p>
          <p>Furthermore most of the prevailing mobile solutions which are acceptably standard are complex and highly advanced to be used by grade 06 students. Some solutions require training programs for even mentors to get used to them. Also most of them are highly resource consuming which is also another main problem for a mobile phone user in the storage perspective. It is clear that although there are several attempts carried out in this purpose, a solution which can address the above mentioned problems is still in need. Therefore the main focus of this research is to develop a solution which will cover all the required aspects and to make Smart Student the best among the list. The table below shows the comparison of the proposed solution with tyr prevailing situations based on several important and key factors.</p>

          <p>
            English proficiency is the most elementary consideration to get into the private sector, and it is important to go forward within the public sector. Foreigners who migrate to English-based countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Australia can routinely fail to accumulate occupations if their English-language skills do not match their professional qualifications. This periodically obliges them to become self-employed or to look for average jobs. English also helps to create interpersonal relationships between various nationalities, as it is the 'most commonly spoken language' in the world, filling it as a typical language for individuals who speak in various dialects. In addition , students pursuing higher education or vocational programs must have English-language skills. In addition, any who decide to look for foreign colleges are expected to complete their English-language examination, most usually IELTS (International English Testing System) or TOEFL (Test of English as a Faraway Language). It is also clear that English is an important and necessary element for the development of civilization. The concern, however, is that while a sector of students living closer to developing areas has a sufficient chance of studying English, the majority of students living in rural areas do not have many opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
           The ability to speak English is an inspiring effect on career performance and social interactions. Comparatively, a very significant portion of graduates understand the value of English language skills while employed behind a position. The object of no return at that time is always past. Enhancing English language skills is a big undertaking and a long-term learning activity. Students must understand the value of English, set up a curriculum to learn all the skills and make the most of all the usable tools. The biggest concern, though, is that most organisations tend to improve English skills after concentrating on technical skills.

           As mentioned above in the Introductory section, English has three key facets, such as hearing, speaking and writing. Any of the available eLearning platforms in the world concentrate only on one particular feature of English that creates students who are only comprehensive in one of the areas listed above. Moreover, as a result, the learning tools used for reading and speaking are better than those used for writing. For eg, there are platforms such as Reddit and Medium for reading and platforms such as Duolingo and Hello English for speaking. The creation of a hybrid eLearning program, including reading , writing and speaking English, is therefore one of the key needs of the national academy.

          </p>
          <p>
        The student assessment and response confirmation process is as critical as the question-making process in a well-structured learning management system. While solutions have been developed to meet the educational requirements for the convenience of students, a solution to meet the requirements for the convenience of teaching has not yet been developed. The local academy therefore wants, as a whole, a mobile, comfortable hybrid system that covers all learning facets of English along with a teacher dashboard.

           The main objective of this research is to develop a hybrid solution to improve and evaluate the Spoken English, Written English, English Listening and English Reading abilities of the grade 06 students. To bring out this main objective in a more creative and an effective manner, the complete solution is divided into four major components. The first component focuses on improving and evaluating the Written English knowledge of students while the second component focuses on improving and evaluating the Spoken English knowledge of the students. The third component is for the convenience of the mentor where the mentor can view the results in an organized dashboard and also it is possible for the mentor to predict the marks for each exercise depending on external factors. The fourth component is a hybrid game which includes a brain development and an interactive vocabulary development game. As a whole the product was developed by taking the above mentioned four research areas as the main objectives. In addition to the main objective several specific objectives were designed to increase the productivity and efficiency of the product while maintaining the commercial quality.</p>

              <li>English language plays an important role in our lives because it makes communication between different countries the only common language across the globe. English books are the common available medium of literature and information that is accessible to everyone. English in Sri Lanka is fluently spoken by approximately 23.8% of the population, and widely used for official and commercial purposes. It is the native language of approximately 74,000 people, mainly in urban areas. Nowadays English is one of the main 24 subjects of school syllabus in Sri Lanka. There are three categories of grammar, spoken and listening lessons in the school English pupils’ book. So most of the time teaching methods are different from urban province schools than the rural province schools. According to that reason those students’ knowledge was different. With the rapid enchantment of technology, the use of mobile phones has increased a lot. Therefore modern society tends to use mobile phones to make their lives easier rather than sticking to traditional methods. The most important fact is that this is followed not only by adults but also by teenagers and children. The best example is that most of the parents use online learning platforms such as Youtube to teach students using videos. Therefore generally students who are in grade 06 are not interested to study using books but by using online methods specifically related to mobile technologies. When compared to the global academia most of the developed countries use this method which has brought them positive results when used within the limits. But in Sri Lanka the assets available for the students, specifically those who are starting their secondary education is very much limited. The main objective of this research is to develop a hybrid solution to improve and evaluate the Spoken English, Written English, English Listening and English Reading abilities of the grade 06 students. To bring out this main objective in a more creative and an effective manner, the complete solution is divided into four major components. The first component focuses on improving and evaluating the Written English knowledge of students while the second component focuses on improving and evaluating the Spoken English knowledge of the students. The third component is for the convenience of the mentor where the mentor can view the results in an organized dashboard and also it is possible for the mentor to predict the marks for each exercise depending on external factors. The fourth component is a hybrid game which includes a brain development and an interactive 25 vocabulary development game. As a whole the product was developed by taking the above mentioned four research areas as the main objectives. In addition to the main objective several specific objectives were designed to increase the productivity and efficiency of the product while maintaining the commercial quality

              <li>English language plays an important role in our lives because it makes communication between different countries the only common language across the globe. English books are the common available medium of literature and information that is accessible to everyone. English in Sri Lanka is fluently spoken by approximately 23.8% of the population, and widely used for official and commercial purposes. It is the native language of approximately 74,000 people, mainly in urban areas. Nowadays English is one of the main subjects of school syllabus in Sri Lanka.

One common approach for solving this type of prediction problem is to extract as many attributes as possible, sometimes as many as hundreds. By evaluating the value of each attribute, researchers can attempt to predict exam grades or other variables using linear regression or multiple regression methods. Usually, when using regression, one tries to predict the dependent variables’ values using independent attributes of different types. The number of independent variables is very large and includes age and gender marks of the term test, educational level of parents , emotional and social factors , and even the complexity measure of teachers’ notes . Other methods used in tackling the grade prediction problem are the factor analysis or other classification schemes with statistical analysis student’s exam grades. We also demonstrate - by using multiple regression and machine learning that other social parameters are also influential in determining a student’s grade. Moreover, they can help predict which students are likely to fail the test.</li>

          <p>Nowadays knowing English language increases your chances of getting a good job in a multinational company within your home country or for finding work abroad. It is also the language of international communication, the media, and the internet, so learning English is important for socializing and entertainment as well as work. So for that reason, English learning can be considered so important.</p>

          <p>Language is one of the mediums of expressing our ideas, feelings, and emotions. And if we think about language in the present world then English is one of the most used languages in the world and also English is used as a second language in Sri Lanka. English is introduced here at the primary level and it's inclusion continues till the tertiary level of education. Most of the students in rural areas are weak in English language due to a lack of skilled and trained teachers who are familiar with the modern methods and approaches of teaching and lack of materials for teaching in the classroom. Further primary level English curriculum implementation is essential to achieve the English language competency in rural areas since students in rural areas are performing poorly in English compared to the urban counterparts.</p>

          <p>Based on the above collected facts it is clear that the solution should cover every aspect of English to fulfill the requirements needed to the society. Therefore the main focus of this research is to develop a hybrid solution to improve and evaluate the Spoken English, Written English,  English Listening  and English Reading abilities of the grade 06 students. To bring out this in a more creative and an effective manner, the complete solution is divided into four major components as shown above. The first component focuses on improving and evaluating the Written English knowledge of students while the second component focuses on improving and evaluating the Spoken English knowledge of the students. The third component is for the convenience of the mentor where the mentor can view the results in an organized dashboard and also it is possible for the mentor to predict the marks for each exercise depending on external factors. The fourth component is a hybrid game which includes a brain development and an interactive vocabulary development game. </p>

The above introduction on the complete mechanism of the solution explains how the 04 major components collaboratively function together. The main focus of this document is on the Written English component which is the initial sector of the Smart Student Application. All the other components are developed parallel to this component while covering all the discussed objectives.The diagram below shows the overall workflow of the Smart Student system.

          </div>

          <p>In the game module as a outline we mainly developed a game to achieve main objectives. Thats are vocabulary skill improvement and brain development through a mobile game. So , if we study little bit about how games are using in education, there are so many information that we can refer.</p>
          <p>Educational games that are specifically designed or have incidental or secondary educational significance for academic purposes. In a learning environment, all types of games can be used, but educational games are games that are intended to help individuals learn about certain topics, broaden concepts, improve growth, understand a historical event or culture, or help them learn a skill while they play. Educators and the government realize the benefits that  gaming has on learning. Games teach us goals, rules, problem solving as a story.
 
</p>

          <p>If we study about benefits that has on gaming. The gaming is a social activity so, students become socialized because of games. And another big advantage is gaming improves critical thinking on students. So gaming can be used on learning purposes on students. Because students like interesting ways to do their learning because, current education system is much bored system to learn.</p>
          <p>In our solution, we mainly developed two separate games to achieve two objectives that I mentioned earlier. So, I used two different game developing softwares. Android studio and Unity 3D are the main softwares that I used.  I developed a English Vocabulary improvement game using Android studio.  In my android game I developed it as 3-tier architecture. And in my android app I hard coded the answers of my game levls. I did it because in a game first we decided game levels answers that will never change. And if the answers on the application then we can match the answer quickly. It is a good way to up lift the performance of the game.</p>

          <p>The brain development game is mainly focused on increasing the thinking and analyzing power of students. It is important to note that the Implementation was done using both Android Studio and Unity3D to test the performance of the game since the logical complexity is high at each level. When compared to Android Studio, Unity3D is easier to use if both the software are not familiar. Furthermore, regardless of whether you should know Android Studio and not Unity 3D, you would just profit by that in a specific way.</p>

          <p>
           Since most games contain things like realistic resources, sound resources, an explicit treatment of client input, liveliness and so forth and so on, and a game motor like Unity 3D is extraordinarily evolved to be acceptable at taking care of those things, whereas increasingly "nonexclusive" improvement devices like Android Studio, Eclipse, Visual Studio, etc. All things considered, nonexclusive. Solidarity 3D additionally lets you run the game inside the game supervisor, empowering you to change the properties of your game resources legitimately and see the outcomes right away. You would need to grow a large portion of such prospects yourself should you make your game in an apparatus like Android Studio[2].
          </p>

          <p>The coding portion of building up a game is best made in a device for coding, and Unity 3D in and without anyone else isn't a coding instrument. For that part, you need an extra tool likeMonoDevelop (which you get packaged with Unity 3D) or Visual Studio, whereas the Unity 3D editorial manager is made for building the game scenes and taking care of the game resources.</p>

          <p>It is exceptionally lightweight and asset the executives is done entirely well in this IDE. It boots up quickly when contrasted with other improvement IDEs. It's anything but a memory hungry IDE. Even beginners can work with this IDE very easily. Emulator begins extremely delayed in Android Studio, possibly that is where it needs improvement. It takes a great deal of memory space to introduce the IDE. Heavy application and will hinder PC execution[3].</p>

          <p>The motor is exceptionally favored for its all-inclusive help to 27 stages. The application created and conveyed can be effortlessly shared between PC, web, and versatile stages. Moreover, the spry philosophy empowers quick prototyping and steady discharges, which thus accelerate game development. The content manager is given by IDE to compose the code, however once in a while, a particular code supervisor is likewise utilized by the designers to mitigate disarray. Moreover, the incorporated improvement supervisor support JavaScript and C# for scripting and offers eminent highlights that are perfect for the game development. The excellent sound and special visualizations are upheld by the motor that facilitates the game turn of events. The visuals are versatile on each screen and gadget with no twisting or bargain with the picture quality. It's an unquestionable requirement. The fledgling designers need the straightforward documentation that is given in detail by the Unity motor. The definite documentation incorporates the clarification of each little topic. The troubleshooting and tweaking are incredibly simpler with Unity game advancement since all the game factors are shown during interactivity, which thusly permits the designers to investigate the procedure at runtime. Not to state, yet the motor lingers behind from a graphical perspective. It doesn't offer a variety of apparatuses to make staggering illustrations instead of other game advancement engines. In Unity 5 motor, the inherent help for the PhysX material science motor has some presentation issues and comes up short on some significant functionalities which should be added to make the incredible game app. The designers need to have licenses for the best illustrations, organization, and execution upgrades. These licenses are costly to buy. Besides, the utilization of rendering, cradle support, stencil support, and truly more highlights scale up the advancement costs because of costly licenses. The code is steady in Unity rather than different motors and pressed with extraordinary engineering that improves the game application execution. Be that as it may, inaccessibility of the source code makes discovering, tending to, and fixing the exhibition issues difficult. The game created utilizing Unity motor devours more memory, which thus makes OOM blunders and investigating issues in the applications[4].</p>

          <p>The Written English module is implemented based on several advanced logics. Initially, the product component has various types of exercises built within it covering most of the learning techniques including questions to underline, questions to mark true or false, and questions to fill in the blanks. Further, it is important to note that in some instances the questions are organized into lessons where a lesson contains questions of all the types.</p>
          <p>The Written English module follows a unique method to load the questions into the front end which is known as fetched HTTP calls. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers. HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and a server. Here the questions are stored on a remote database and fetched through HTTP calls [10]. The Fetch API is a modern replacement for XHR; it was introduced in browsers recently to make asynchronous HTTP requests easier to do in JavaScript, both for developers and other APIs that build on top of Fetch[11].</p>

          

          <p>The Written module also allows the users to see their progress, rank, scores, and other statistics for written quizzes which will provide the user as well as the mentor a productive environment to work with. The user-friendly interfaces further make the system more usable to children making the product more interesting. The answer validation process of the Written English module is implemented using Firebase ML vision and a custom drawing canvas. Firebase ML Kit is a mobile SDK that makes it easier for mobile developers to include machine learning capabilities in their applications. ML Kit is a wrapper over the complexities of including and using machine learning capabilities in your mobile app [7][8]. The complete mechanism of the Written English module can be divided into 6 main phases.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The user draws on custom canvas</li>
<li>If the user does not draw for 1s recognize it as break</li>
<li>Get the bitmap from canvas</li>
<li>Provide bitmap as input to the detector</li>
<li>Display text</li>
<li>Compare the recognized text with the correct answer of the question</li>
	</ul>

<p>The Spoken English module follows a unique method to load the questions into the front end which is known as fetched HTTP calls. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers. HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server. Here the questions are stored on a remote database and fetched through HTTP calls.

            The next most important feature implemented is the progress status and the score related to the component. Users will be able to see their progress, rank, scores and other statistics for spoken quizzes. The score calculation process is totally based on the identification of the answers based on the given voice output to the product. This is totally implemented using Google speech recognizer. Google has a great Speech Recognition API. This API converts spoken text into written text, briefly Speech to Text. You can simply speak in a microphone and Google API will translate this into written text. The API has excellent results for English language. The complete mechanism of the Spoken English module can be divided into 6 main phases. This can also be referred to as the speech recognition and answer validation process in technical terms.    </p>

          <ul>
	<li>User click speak button</li>
<li>Google speech recognizer module is configured to identified English and launched</li>
<li>User speak and Google speech recognizer capture the audio</li>
<li>Google speech recognizer process audio and output the identified text</li>
<li>Identified text is displayed to the user</li>
<li>Identified text is compared to the original text and marks are calculated</li>
	</ul>

          <p>Speech-to-Text has three main methods to perform speech recognition. These are listed below: </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Synchronous Recognition</b> (REST and gRPC) sends audio data to the Speech-to-Text API, performs recognition on that data, and returns results after all audio has been processed. Synchronous recognition requests are limited to audio data of 1 minute or less in duration.</li>
<li><b>Asynchronous Recognition</b> (REST and gRPC) sends audio data to the Speech-to-Text API and initiates a Long Running Operation. Using this operation, you can periodically poll for recognition results. Use asynchronous requests for audio data of any duration up to 480 minutes.</li>
<li><b>Streaming Recognition</b> (gRPC only) performs recognition on audio data provided within a gRPC bi-directional stream. Streaming requests are designed for real-time recognition purposes, such as capturing live audio from a microphone. Streaming recognition provides interim results while audio is being captured, allowing results to appear, for example, while a user is still speaking.</li>

          <p>In this study, we utilized various ML techniques to study student engagement in different VLE activities.selected techniques were suitable for both domain and categorical educational attributes. Brief details of the ML, training, testing, and input data are provided below. Machine Learning Technique. Various types of ML techniques have been used as predictive models.</p>

          <p>ML techniques tested as predictive models in the current study are described below. Decision Tree (DT). A DT has a tree-like structure with internal nodes represented by rectangles and leaves represented by ovals. An internal node has two or more child nodes. ,e internal nodes represent dataset features, and the branches represent the values of these features. Each leaf contains a class related to the dataset . DT is trained with a training set containing tuples. Finally, the DT is used to classify a dataset with unknown class labels . DTs are primarily used to process information for decision-making  tree is constructed from the dataset by determining which attributes best split the input features at the child nodes. In this case, we used the concept of information gain which is dependent on information theory. When a node has minimum entropy (highest information gain), that node is used as a split node . A DT is important when a study seeks to determine which features are important in a student prediction model .  rules for DTs are easy to understand and interpret, and we know exactly which classifier leads to a decision.  A J48 decision tree belongs to the DT family; it both produces rules and creates the tree from a dataset.  J48 algorithm is an improved version algorithm. It is a sample-predictive ML model that predicts the target values of an unseen database based on the different values of input features in the current dataset. ,e rules of this approach are easily interpreted. Moreover, this method is an implementation of the ID3 (interactive dichotomize) algorithm and is a supervised ML algorithm used primarily for classification problems. ,e internal nodes of a J48 decision tree represent the input features (attributes), and the branches of the tree represent the possible values of the input features in the new dataset. Finally, the terminal nodes (leaves) display the final values of target variables ,e attribute-selection process is based on the information gain method (gain ratio) . J48 decision tree works for both numeric and categorical variables; moreover, it determines the variables that are best at splitting the dataset attribute with the highest gain ratio reflects the best split point.  </p>

<p>A plethora of pattern recognition methods have been applied to problems in bioinformatics including rule based, statistical methods and machine learning -based methodologies. The goal of machine learning is to train a computer system to distinguish  classify cases based on known examples. Machine learning methods include sev-eral widely differing approaches such as support vector machines, neural networks, Bayesian classifiers, random forests and decision trees.In the following discussion we concentrate on machine learning methods as they are nowadays widely used to tackle complex phenomena, which would be otherwise difficult to handle. Successful machine learning method development requires a good quality training set. The data-set should represent the space of possible cases. Thisspace is huge for genetic variations as they can have somany different effects and underlying mechanisms. Another aspect is the choice of the machine learning approach. There is not a superior architecture among them. Third, the quality of the predictor depends on how the training has been done, which features are used and insufficient to adequately describe the pattern in the feature space. Another problem is overfitting, which means that the learner, due to sparse data,complex model or excessive learning procedure, describes noise or random features in the training dataset, instead of the real phenomenon. It is crucial to avoid overfitting as it leads to decreased performance in real cases. Many predictors provide a measure for the probability of prediction, in this domain a measure of how likely the variation is pathogenic. This information can be used for ranking the investigated cases. A more advanced version is to obtain e.g. by bootstrapping an estimate of the standard error of the prediction indicative of the prediction.</p>

          <p>A common definition of machine learning is (Mitchell, 1997): “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.” Basically, machine learning is the ability of a computer to learn from experience (Mitchell, 1997). Experience is usually given in the form of input data. Looking at this data, the computer can find dependencies in the data that are too complex for a human to form. Machine learning can be used to reveal a hidden class structure in an unstructured data, or it can be used to find dependencies in a structured data to make predictions. Latter is the main focus of the thesis. 3.1.2. Predictive analytics Predictive analytics is the act of predicting future events and behaviors present in previously unseen data, using a model built from similar past data (Nyce, 2007; Shmueli, 2011). It has a wide range of applications in different fields, such as finance, education, healthcare, and law (Sas, 2017). The method of application in all these fields is similar. Using previously collected data, a machine learning algorithm finds the relations between different properties of the data. The resulting model is able to predict one of the properties of future data based on properties (Eckerson, 2007)</p>


          <p>For the sake of simplicity, the data has only one independent variable. Figure 1 depicts a two dimensional graph that shows the relation between the student age and the dependent variable indicating whether they have passed the exam or not. </p>
